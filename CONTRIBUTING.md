# Contributing to remark-lint-frontmatter-validation

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This repository contains a remark lint rule and CLI for validating Markdown
frontmatter against JSON Schema.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.0.0` (see `package.json#engines`)
- npm `>=11`
- Git

## Local setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies from the repository root:

   ```bash
   npm ci --force
   ```

3. Run the main quality gate:

   ```bash
   npm run lint:all
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   ```

## Recommended development workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Add or update tests in `test/` when behavior changes.
4. Update relevant documentation and root docs when needed.
5. Run validation commands before opening a pull request.

## Debugging and logging policy

To keep runtime plugin behavior predictable, this repository enforces strict
rules for logging and debugger usage in source code.

- `src/**` except `src/cli.ts`: do **not** commit `console.*` or `debugger`
  statements.
- `scripts/**`: `console.log`/`console.warn`/`console.error` are allowed for
  CLI progress and diagnostics.
- `test/**`: avoid noisy logging by default; only keep it when a test is
  explicitly validating logging behavior.

When adding script output, prefer this severity split:

- `console.log`: normal progress
- `console.warn`: recoverable issue or fallback behavior
- `console.error`: failure path (typically followed by a non-zero exit code)

## Project layout

```text
.
├── src/                  # Remark plugin, CLI, and validation source
├── test/                 # Unit and integration tests
├── .github/              # Workflows and automation configs
└── package.json          # Scripts, dependencies, metadata
```

## Validation commands

Use these commands locally before submitting a pull request:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint:all`

Optional focused checks:

- `npm run changelog:preview` to preview unreleased changelog output
- `npm run lint:package-check` to verify the published package shape

## Commit guidance

Gitmoji + Conventional type commits are recommended because release notes and
changelog tooling are commit-message aware.

Format:

- `:gitmoji: type(scope?): subject`

Examples:

- `:sparkles: feat(cli): add schema-map support`
- `:bug: fix(schema): reject disallowed remote refs`
- `:memo: docs: clarify frontmatter options`

## Pull request expectations

- Keep pull requests scoped and reviewable.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Keep docs in sync with implementation changes.
- Do not include generated lockfile churn unrelated to the change.
